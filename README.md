# VoIP Application with SIP and RTP

A simple VoIP implementation using SIP for signaling and RTP for audio transmission. The application consists of two clients - a sender (client1.py) that streams audio from a WAV file, and a receiver (client2.py) that plays the received audio.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- tkinter (usually included with Python)
- pyaudio (`pip install pyaudio`)

## Instructions for Running

### 1. Open two terminal windows
You'll need one for the sender and one for the receiver.

### 2. Run the sender (Client 1)
python client1.py <local_ip> <local_port> <remote_ip> <remote_port>

Example for local testing:
python client1.py 127.0.0.1 6000 127.0.0.1 6002


### 3. Run the receiver (Client 2)
python client2.py <local_ip> <local_port> <remote_ip> <remote_port>

Example matching the sender:
python client2.py 127.0.0.1 6002 127.0.0.1 6000


### 4. Using the GUI Applications

#### Sender (Client 1):
1. Click "Browse" to select a WAV audio file
2. Click "Start Call" to initiate the VoIP session
3. Click "End Call" to terminate the session

#### Receiver (Client 2):
1. Click "Listen" to wait for incoming calls
2. Click "Stop" to stop receiving

## Implementation Details

### Key Features
✅ SIP Protocol Implementation:
- INVITE, 200 OK, ACK, and BYE messages
- SDP negotiation for RTP parameters

✅ RTP Audio Streaming:
- PCMU codec support
- Packet sequencing and timing
- Basic RTCP sender reports

✅ GUI Interface:
- Simple controls for call management
- Status feedback

✅ Error Handling:
- SIP message parsing and validation
- Timeout handling
- Audio file validation

### Port Usage
- SIP signaling uses the specified port + 100 (e.g., 6000 becomes 6100)
- RTP uses the specified port (e.g., 6000)
- RTCP uses RTP port + 1 (e.g., 6001)

## Testing and Troubleshooting

### Test Cases
| Test Case | Expected Result |
|-----------|-----------------|
| Start call with valid WAV file | Audio should play on receiver |
| Try starting call without selecting file | Error message in status |
| End call during transmission | Audio should stop immediately |
| Network interruption | Call should timeout after 10 seconds |

### Useful Commands
Check if ports are available:
netstat -an | find "6000"


Test audio playback (verify pyaudio works):
```python
import pyaudio
p = pyaudio.PyAudio()
p.terminate()
Verify Python version:


python --version
Known Limitations
Only supports WAV files with specific format (16-bit PCM, 8000Hz)

No encryption of audio streams

Basic error recovery only
